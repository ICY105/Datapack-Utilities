#in_0: input angle in degrees, multiplied by 10. INPUT MUST BE IN THE INTERVAL OF [-1800,1800]
#out_0: cosine of angle result, also multiplied by 10

# See the sin function for detailed notes on the implementation and error of this function

#NOTES FOR SELF: add 900 to the input, and if the input is then greater than 1800, just subtract 3600. Voila
